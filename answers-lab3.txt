1. It's important only to distinguish between traps that push an error code
   and those that don't.

2. Softint behaved correctly right off the bat. After the page fault handler
   falls through a general protection fault is triggered.

Challenge!:
  I did the challenge where you change the TRAPHANDLER macros. I created a
  vectors table in the .data segment and made each entry point to a
  traphandler in the .text segments. In this way I didn't have to
  _individually_ name all of the trap handlers because their idt index is
  already a good enough identifier.
