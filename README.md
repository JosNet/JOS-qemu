this is JOSnet : prepare to die
===============================
  what?
    -we are putting JOS on amazon's ec2
    -it's going to run a webserver as a proof of concept

  why?
    -it's pretty cool
    -OS'es are cool
    -xen is cool
    -6.828 final projects are cool

  how?
    -write a driver for our favorite nic. Seems like the e1000e
    currently
    -port some of libc into JOS to run our webserver
    -get some sort of socket interface running. bsd sockets preferred
    -port JOS over to xen since that what amazon runs


  will all of the computers form a sinularity and conspire to extinguish the human race as a result of this?
    -depends on how many bugs I have in my virtual memory manager
